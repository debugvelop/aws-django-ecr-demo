# AWS Demo: Containerized Django
Let's say right now you want to try Django. Then at some point in the future you want to reset it. Unconciously you had already installed so much that reinstall Django will break something. One way to prevent this nightmare is by containerizing Django and store it in a container registry.

### Requirement
* AWS account (free tier is sufficient)

### Create Django Docker Image in EC2
1. Go to EC2 Management Console then launch an EC2 instance with this configuration:
   AMI | Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS x86_64
   ----------------|-------------------
   Instance Type | t2.micro
   Security Groups | SSH(22), HTTP(80)
2. Connect to the instance.
3. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS.
```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common -y
```
4. Add and verify Dockerâ€™s official GPG key -> `9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88`.
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
```
5. Set Docker's repository to stable version.
```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```
6. Install Docker
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker-ce -y
```
7. Verify Docker is successfully installed.
```
sudo docker run hello-world
```
8. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/debugvelop/aws-django-ecr-demo.git
```
9. Build the image (this may take a while).
```
cd aws-django-ecr-demo
sudo docker build -t demo .
```
10. Verify the image is successfully built by run it and open the instance's public IP address on your browser.
```
sudo docker run demo -d -p 80:8000
```

### Upload Django Docker Image to Container Registry
1. Go to IAM Console then add a new user for the instance with this configuration
    Access type | Programmatic Access
    ----------------|----------------
    Set permissions | Attach existing policies directly (AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess)
2. Save **access key ID** and **secret access key**.
3. Back to the instance's SSH and install AWS CLI.
```
sudo apt install unzip -y
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install -i /usr/local/aws-cli -b /usr/local/bin
```
4. Verify that AWS CLI is installed correctly.
```
aws --version
```
5. Connect AWS CLI to IAM User by entering previously saved **access key ID** and **secret access key**. Leave others on default (just enter).
```
aws configure
```
6. Go to Elastic Container Registry Management Console then create a new repository named **demo**.
7. Select **demo** repository and click *View push commands*.
8. Connect AWS ECR to your AWS CLI by entering the first command. The pattern should be similar as below (don't copy the command below).
```
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-southeast-2 | **sudo** docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 964277983528.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com
```
9. Tag the image with the third command. The pattern should be similar as below (don't copy the command below).
```
sudo docker tag demo:latest 964277983528.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/demo:latest
```
10. Push it. The pattern should be similar as below (don't copy the command below).
```
sudo docker push 964277983528.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/demo:latest
```
* If you'd like to use the image, change **push** to **pull** from the command above.
